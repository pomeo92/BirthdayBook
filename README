This is the source code of contact book where you may store you contacts

To run it you need to execute tree_view.py file.

Features:
 * Add contact(name is unique, person may have multiple phones)
 * Delete contact
 * Notify about today birthdays

For backend was used SQLite. For now it was tested under Linux.

Don't run it simultaneously multiple times this will cause to nasty bugs like
locked db. To check what process locked it type in root of the project:
 $ fuser contacts.db

It won't be fixed because its a feature.
